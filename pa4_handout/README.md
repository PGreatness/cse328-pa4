# Programming Assignment 4 Handout

- `pa4_template`
    - Please start with this program template. 
    - Please pay special attention to the fragment shader from 
      TA Help Page -> Lecture on PA3 -> Sample Code -> OpenGLTessellationShpere, 
      which implements a sample Phong shading model (for smooth-shaded spheres). 
    - If you have problems understanding the sample code, 
      you may refer to `lighting.pdf` for Phong shading model as well as 
      [this](https://learnopengl.com/Lighting/Basic-Lighting) online tutorial. 
- `quadric-surfaces.pdf`
    - Extracted from *Computer Graphics with OpenGL 4th Ed (Pearson New International Ed)*
    - Please refer to this pdf for the parametric equation of spheres, ellipsoids and torus. 
- `lighting.pdf`
    - Extracted from *OpenGL Programming Guide 9th Ed*, Chapter 7
    - Optional. You may refer to this pdf if you have problems understanding the startwith program (especially the shaders). 
- `tessellation.pdf`
    - Extracted from *OpenGL Programming Guide 9th Ed*, Chapter 9
    - Please refer to this pdf for the method to render parametric surfaces with tessellation shaders. 
- There are many other useful online tutorials. 
  Please keep in mind that you should take code from online sources (including those mentioned in this file) 
  only after testing, and use them at your own risk.
